QuasiQuoter for non-interpolated strings, texts and bytestrings.

The "s" quoter contains a multi-line string with no interpolation at all,
except that the leading newline is trimmed and carriage returns stripped.

    {-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes #-}
    import Data.Text (Text)
    import Data.String.QQ
    foo :: Text -- "String", "ByteString" etc also works
    foo = [s|
    Well here is a
        multi-line string!
    |]

Any instance of the IsString type is permitted.

(For GHC versions 6, write "[$s||]" instead of "[s||]".)
